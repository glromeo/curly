<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>curl</B> <B>[options]</B> <I>[URL...]</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>curl</B>  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
       supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,
       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  POP3,  POP3S,  RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS,
       SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work  without
       user interaction.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-
       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-
       fer  resume,  Metalink,  and more. As you will see below, the number of
       features will make your head spin!

       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See
       <I>libcurl(3)</I> for details.


</PRE>
<H2>URL</H2><PRE>
       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-
       tion in RFC 3986.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets
       within braces as in:

         http://site.{one,two,three}.com

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt

         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)

         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt

       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next
       to each other:

         http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be
       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order.

       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
       or letter:

         http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt

         http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt

       When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,
       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not
       trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but
       is instead <B>very</B> liberal with what it accepts.

       curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
       that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con-
       nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
       files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between
       separate curl invokes.


</PRE>
<H2>PROGRESS METER</H2><PRE>
       curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating
       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time
       left, etc. The progress meter displays number of bytes and  the  speeds
       are  in  bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based.
       For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.

       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke
       curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
       it <I>disables</I> the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
       mixing progress meter and response data.

       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
       redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (&gt;),  <I>-o,</I>
       <I>--output</I> or similar.

       It  is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit
       out any response data to the terminal.

       If you prefer a progress  "bar"  instead  of  the  regular  meter,  <I>-#,</I>
       <I>--progress-bar</I>  is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
       completely with the <I>-s,</I> <I>--silent</I> option.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an
       additional value next to them.

       The  short  "single-dash"  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
       is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I> for
       example, requires a space between it and its value.

       Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used
       immediately  next  to  each other, like for example you can specify all
       the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --<B>option</B> and yet again
       disabled  with --<B>no-</B>option. That is, you use the exact same option name
       but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and
       show  the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was
       added in  7.19.0.  Previously  most  options  were  toggled  on/off  on
       repeated use of the same command line option.)
              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication
              method,  which  you  can  do with <I>--basic</I>, <I>--digest</I>, <I>--ntlm</I>, and
              <I>--negotiate</I>.

              Using <I>--anyauth</I> is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
              since  it  may require data to be sent twice and then the client
              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when  uploading
              from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              Used together with <I>-u,</I> <I>--user</I>.

              See also <I>--proxy-anyauth</I> and <I>--basic</I> and <I>--digest</I>.

       -a, --append
              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
              target file instead  of  overwriting  it.  If  the  remote  file
              doesn't  exist,  it  will  be  created.   Note that this flag is
              ignored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

       --basic
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use  HTTP  Basic  authentication  with  the
              remote  host.  This  is  the  default and this option is usually
              pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option
              that  sets  a  different  authentication method (such as <I>--ntlm</I>,
              <I>--digest</I>, or <I>--negotiate</I>).

              Used together with <I>-u,</I> <I>--user</I>.

              See also <I>--proxy-basic</I>.

       --cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the  peer.  The  file  may contain multiple CA certificates. The
              certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built  to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl recognizes the environment variable named  'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if  it  is  set,  and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The windows version of curl will automatically  look  for  a  CA
              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If  curl  is  built  against  the  NSS  SSL library, the NSS PEM
              PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to  be  available  for  this
              option to work properly.

              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
              then this option is supported for  backward  compatibility  with
              curl  to  make  SSL-connections much more efficiently than using
              <I>--cacert</I> if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored,
              and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --cert-status
              (TLS)  Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate
              by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
              extension.

              If  this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g.
              expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
              tificate  has  been  revoked, or no response at all is received,
              the verification fails.

              This is currently only implemented in the  OpenSSL,  GnuTLS  and
              NSS backends.

              Added in 7.41.0.

       --cert-type &lt;type&gt;
              (TLS)  Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate
              is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified,
              PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-E,</I> <I>--cert</I> and <I>--key</I> and <I>--key-type</I>.

       -E, --cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified  client  certificate  file
              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
              col. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if  using  Secure
              Transport,  or  PEM  format  if  using any other engine.  If the
              optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on the
              terminal.  Note  that  this  option assumes a "certificate" file
              that is the private key and the client certificate concatenated!
              See <I>-E,</I> <I>--cert</I> and <I>--key</I> to specify them independently.

              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
              can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
              default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
              nsspem.so)  is  available  then  PEM files may be loaded. If you
              want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it
              with  "./"  prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.
              If the nickname contains ":", it needs to be preceded by "\"  so
              that  it  is not recognized as password delimiter.  If the nick-
              name contains "\", it needs to be escaped as "\\" so that it  is
              not recognized as an escape character.

               https://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              curl  supports,  and  save  the  uncompressed document.  If this
              option is used and the server  sends  an  unsupported  encoding,
              curl will report an error.

       -K, --config &lt;file&gt;
              Specify  which config file to read curl arguments from. The con-
              fig file is a text file in which command line arguments  can  be
              written  which  then will be used as if they were written on the
              actual command line.

              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  con-
              fig  file  line,  separated  by whitespace, colon, or the equals
              sign. Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config
              file  without  the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or
              equals characters can be used as separators. If  the  option  is
              specified  with  one  or  two  dashes,  there can be no colon or
              equals character between the option and its parameter.

              If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be
              enclosed  within  quotes.  Within  double  quotes, the following
              escape sequences are available: \\, \", \t, \n,  \r  and  \v.  A
              backslash  preceding  any  other letter is ignored. If the first
              column of a config line is a '#' character, the rest of the line
              will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical
              line in the config file.

              Specify the filename to <I>-K,</I> <I>--config</I> as '-' to  make  curl  read
              the file from stdin.

              Note  that  to  be able to specify a URL in the config file, you
              need to specify it using the <I>--url</I> option,  and  not  by  simply
              writing  the  URL  on its own line. So, it could look similar to
              this:

              url = "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/"

              When curl is invoked, it always (unless <I>-q,</I> <I>--disable</I>  is  used)
              checks  for  a  default  config  file  and uses it if found. The
              default config file is checked for in the  following  places  in
              this order:

              1)  curl  tries  to find the "home dir": It first checks for the
              CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that,
              it  uses getpwuid() on Unix-like systems (which returns the home

              # and fetch another URL too
              url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
              -O
              referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
              # --- End of example file ---

              This  option  can be used multiple times to load multiple config
              files.

       --connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Maximum time in seconds that  you  allow  curl's  connection  to
              take.   This  only  limits the connection phase, so if curl con-
              nects within the given period it will continue - if not it  will
              exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-m,</I> <I>--max-time</I>.

       --connect-to &lt;HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2&gt;

              For  a  request to the given HOST:PORT pair, connect to CONNECT-
              TO-HOST:CONNECT-TO-PORT instead.  This  option  is  suitable  to
              direct requests at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster
              node in a cluster of servers.   This  option  is  only  used  to
              establish  the  network connection. It does NOT affect the host-
              name/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate  veri-
              fication)  or  for the application protocols.  "host" and "port"
              may be the empty string, meaning "any host/port".   "connect-to-
              host"  and "connect-to-port" may also be the empty string, mean-
              ing "use the request's original host/port".

              This option can be used many times to add many connect rules.

              See also <I>--resolve</I> and <I>-H,</I> <I>--header</I>. Added in 7.49.0.

       -C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
              Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at  the  given  offset.
              The  given  offset  is  the  exact  number of bytes that will be
              skipped, counting from the beginning of the source  file  before
              it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out  where/how  to
              resume  the  transfer. It then uses the given output/input files
              to figure that out.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-r,</I> <I>--range</I>.

              operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using  <I>-v,</I>
              <I>--verbose</I>  will  get  a  warning displayed, but that is the only
              visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

              If this option is used several times, the  last  specified  file
              name will be used.

       -b, --cookie &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
              is supposedly the data previously received from the server in  a
              "Set-Cookie:"   line.    The   data  should  be  in  the  format
              "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

              If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead  treated
              as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
              also activates the cookie engine which  will  make  curl  record
              incoming  cookies,  which  may  be handy if you're using this in
              combination with the <I>-L,</I> <I>--location</I> option or  do  multiple  URL
              transfers on the same invoke.

              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
              HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
              file format.

              The  file  specified with <I>-b,</I> <I>--cookie</I> is only used as input. No
              cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
              <I>-c,</I> <I>--cookie-jar</I> option.

              Exercise  caution  if  you  are  using  this option and multiple
              transfers may occur.  If you use the NAME1=VALUE1; format, or in
              a  file  use  the  Set-Cookie format and don't specify a domain,
              then the cookie is sent for any domain (even after redirects are
              followed)  and cannot be modified by a server-set cookie. If the
              cookie engine is enabled and a server sets a cookie of the  same
              name then both will be sent on a future transfer to that server,
              likely not what you intended.  To address  these  issues  set  a
              domain  in  Set-Cookie  (doing that will include sub domains) or
              use the Netscape format.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and write
              updated cookies back to a file, so using both <I>-b,</I>  <I>--cookie</I>  and
              <I>-c,</I> <I>--cookie-jar</I> in the same command line is common.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the <I>-o,</I> <I>--output</I> option, curl will
              create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
              option  creates the dirs mentioned with the <I>-o,</I> <I>--output</I> option,
              nothing else. If the --output file name uses no dir  or  if  the
              dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will be created.


              Added in 7.19.7.

       --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) This is just an alias for <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I>.

       --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no  extra  pro-
              cessing whatsoever.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              filename.  Data is posted in a  similar  manner  as  <I>-d,</I>  <I>--data</I>
              does,  except  that  newlines and carriage returns are preserved
              and conversions are never done.

              If this option is used several times,  the  ones  following  the
              first will append data as described in <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I>.

       --data-raw &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP)  This  posts data similarly to <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I> but without the
              special interpretation of the @ character.

              See also <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I>. Added in 7.43.0.

       --data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I>  options
              with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

              To  be  CGI-compliant,  the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a <I>name</I>
              followed by a separator and a content specification. The  &lt;data&gt;
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. Just be careful so that the content  doesn't  contain
                     any  =  or  @  symbols, as that will then make the syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

              name=content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass
                     that on. Note that the name part is expected to  be  URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This  will  make  curl  load  data  from  the  given file
                     (including any newlines), URL-encode that data  and  pass
                     it on in the POST.

              application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I>.

              <I>--data-raw</I> is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
              pretation of the @ character. To post data  purely  binary,  you
              should  instead use the <I>--data-binary</I> option.  To URL-encode the
              value of a form field you may use <I>--data-urlencode</I>.

              If any of these options is used more than once on the same  com-
              mand  line,  the  data  pieces specified will be merged together
              with a separating  &amp;-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d
              skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like
              'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              file  name  to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read
              the data from stdin. Multiple files can also be specified. Post-
              ing  data  from  a  file  named  from a file like that, carriage
              returns and newlines will be stripped out. If you don't want the
              @  character  to  have  a  special interpretation use <I>--data-raw</I>
              instead.

              See also <I>--data-binary</I> and <I>--data-urlencode</I> and <I>--data-raw</I>. This
              option overrides <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I> and <I>-I,</I> <I>--head</I> and <I>--upload</I>.

       --delegation &lt;LEVEL&gt;
              (GSS/kerberos)  Set  LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed
              to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

              none   Don't allow any delegation.

              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set
                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of
                     realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       --digest
              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an  authenti-
              cation  scheme  that  prevents the password from being sent over
              the wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the  normal
              <I>-u,</I> <I>--user</I> option to set user name and password.

              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
              used.

              See also <I>-u,</I>  <I>--user</I>  and  <I>--proxy-digest</I>  and  <I>--anyauth</I>.  This
              option overrides <I>--basic</I> and <I>--ntlm</I> and <I>--negotiate</I>.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt  to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP)  (FTP)  Tell  curl  to disable the use of the EPSV command
              when doing passive FTP  transfers.  Curl  will  normally  always
              first  attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it
              will not try using EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
              is an alias for <I>--disable-epsv</I>.

              If  the  server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect
              as EPSV is necessary then.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use <I>-P,</I> <I>--ftp-port</I>.

       -q, --disable
              If  used  as the first parameter on the command line, the <I>curlrc</I>
              config file will not be read and used. See the <I>-K,</I> <I>--config</I>  for
              details on the default config file search path.

       --dns-interface &lt;interface&gt;
              (DNS)  Tell  curl  to send outgoing DNS requests through &lt;inter-
              face&gt;. This option is a counterpart to <I>--interface</I>  (which  does
              not  affect  DNS). The supplied string must be an interface name
              (not an address).

              See also <I>--dns-ipv4-addr</I>  and  <I>--dns-ipv6-addr</I>.  <I>--dns-interface</I>
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv4-addr &lt;address&gt;
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt;  when  making  IPv4  DNS
              requests,  so that the DNS requests originate from this address.
              The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

              See also <I>--dns-interface</I>  and  <I>--dns-ipv6-addr</I>.  <I>--dns-ipv4-addr</I>
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv6-addr &lt;address&gt;
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt;  when  making  IPv6  DNS
              requests,  so that the DNS requests originate from this address.
              The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

              See also <I>--dns-interface</I>  and  <I>--dns-ipv4-addr</I>.  <I>--dns-ipv6-addr</I>
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-servers &lt;addresses&gt;
              Set the list of DNS servers to be used  instead  of  the  system
              default.  The list of IP addresses should be separated with com-
              store cookies.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-o,</I> <I>--output</I>.

       --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
              (TLS)  Specify  the  path  name  to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
              socket. The socket is used to seed the  random  engine  for  SSL
              connections.

              See also <I>--random-file</I>.

       --engine &lt;name&gt;
              (TLS)  Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher opera-
              tions. Use <I>--engine</I> list to print a list of build-time supported
              engines.  Note  that  not  all  (or  none) of the engines may be
              available at run-time.

       --environment
              Sets a range of environment variables, using the names  the  <I>-w,</I>
              <I>--write-out</I>  option supports, to allow easier extraction of use-
              ful information after having run curl.

              <I>--environment</I> requires that the underlying libcurl was built  to
              support RISC OS.

       --expect100-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
              100-continue response when curl emits an  Expects:  100-continue
              header  in  its  request.  By default curl will wait one second.
              This option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting,  it
              will continue as if the response has been received.

              See also <I>--connect-timeout</I>. Added in 7.47.0.

       --fail-early
              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,
              it will attempt to operate on each given URL,  one  by  one.  By
              default,  it will ignore errors if there are more URLs given and
              the last URL's  success  will  determine  the  error  code  curl
              returns.  So  early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent suc-
              cessful transfers.

              Using this option, curl will instead  return  an  error  on  the
              first  transfer  that  fails,  independent of the amount of URLs
              that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer  fail-
              is mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal  with
              failed  attempts.  In  normal cases when an HTTP server fails to
              deliver a document, it  returns  an  HTML  document  stating  so
              (which  often  also describes why and more). This flag will pre-
              vent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

              This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where  non-
              successful  response  codes  will  slip through, especially when
              authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

       --false-start
              (TLS) Tells curl to use false start during  the  TLS  handshake.
              False  start  is  a  mode  where a TLS client will start sending
              application data before verifying the server's Finished message,
              thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

              This  is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure Trans-
              port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

              Added in 7.42.0.

       --form-string &lt;name=string&gt;
              (HTTP) Similar to <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I> except that the  value  string  for
              the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and '&lt;' char-
              acters, and the ';type=' string in the  value  have  no  special
              meaning.  Use  this  in  preference to <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I> if there's any
              possibility that the string value may accidentally  trigger  the
              '@' or '&lt;' features of <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I>.

              See also <I>-F,</I> <I>--form</I>.

       -F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;
              (HTTP)  This  lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user
              has pressed the submit button. This causes  curl  to  POST  data
              using  the  Content-Type  multipart/form-data  according  to RFC
              2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To  force  the
              'content'  part  to  be  a  file, prefix the file name with an @
              sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the  file
              name  with  the symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then
              that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a  file  upload,
              while  the  &lt;  makes  a text field and just get the contents for
              that text field from a file.

              Example: to send an image to a server, where  'profile'  is  the
              name of the form-field to which portrait.jpg will be the input:

               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

              To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the file-
              name. This goes for both @ and &lt;  constructs.  Unfortunately  it
              does  not support reading the file from a named pipe or similar,
              as it needs the full size before the transfer starts.

              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by  dou-
              ble-quotes like:

               curl   -F  "file=@\"localfile\";filename=\"nameinpost\""  exam-
              ple.com

              or

               curl -F 'file=@"localfile";filename="nameinpost"' example.com

              Note that if a filename/path is  quoted  by  double-quotes,  any
              double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
              backslash.

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              This option can be used multiple times.

              This option overrides <I>-d,</I> <I>--data</I> and <I>-I,</I> <I>--head</I> and <I>--upload</I>.

       --ftp-account &lt;data&gt;
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name
              and  password has been provided, this data is sent off using the
              ACCT command.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.13.0.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
              send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
              "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
              the certificate.

              Added in 7.15.5.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP  SFTP)  When  an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that
              doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior  of
              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
              create missing directories.

              See also <I>--create-dirs</I>.

       --ftp-method &lt;method&gt;
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
              FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
              ing alternatives:

                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

       Added in 7.15.1.

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive  is  the
              internal  default behavior, but using this option can be used to
              override a previous <I>-P,</I> <I>--ftp-port</I> option.

              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
              used.  Undoing  an  enforced passive really isn't doable but you
              must then instead enforce the correct <I>-P,</I> <I>--ftp-port</I> again.

              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
              then PASV, unless <I>--disable-epsv</I> is used.

              See also <I>--disable-epsv</I>. Added in 7.11.0.

       -P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
              (FTP)  Reverses  the  default initiator/listener roles when con-
              necting with FTP. This option makes curl use active  mode.  curl
              then  tells the server to connect back to the client's specified
              address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
              IP  address  and  port for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be
              one of:

              interface
                     i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's  IP  address  you
                     want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     i.e "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              -      make  curl  pick the same IP address that is already used
                     for the control connection

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be  used.  Dis-
       able  the  use  of PORT with <I>--ftp-pasv</I>. Disable the attempt to use the
       EPRT command instead of PORT by using <I>--disable-eprt</I>.  EPRT  is  really
       PORT++.

       Since  7.19.5,  you  can  append  ":[start]-[end]"  to the right of the
       address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you  spec-
       ify  a  port  range,  from  a lower to a higher number. A single number
       works as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure  since
       the port may not be available.

       See also <I>--ftp-pasv</I> and <I>--disable-eprt</I>.

              This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
              of PASV.

              See also <I>--ftp-pasv</I>. Added in 7.14.2.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode &lt;active/passive&gt;
              (FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate  the
              shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
              reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
              the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

              See also <I>--ftp-ssl-ccc</I>. Added in 7.16.2.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
              munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

              See also <I>--ssl</I> and <I>--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode</I>. Added in 7.16.1.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP  login,  clear  for  transfer.
              Allows  secure  authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers
              for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server  doesn't  sup-
              port SSL/TLS.

              Added in 7.16.0.

       -G, --get
              When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with <I>-d,</I>
              <I>--data</I>, <I>--data-binary</I> or <I>--data-urlencode</I> to be used in an  HTTP
              GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
              used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.

              If  used  in  combination  with  <I>-I,</I>  <I>--head</I>, the POST data will
              instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
              used.  This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but you
              should then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.

       -g, --globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set
              this  option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[]
              without having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note  that
              these  letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should
              be encoded according to the URI standard.

       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
              command  HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a
              value  then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such
              as -H "X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".

              curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <B>not</B> add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              See also the <I>-A,</I> <I>--user-agent</I> and <I>-e,</I> <I>--referer</I> options.

              Starting in 7.37.0, you need <I>--proxy-header</I> to send custom head-
              ers intended for a proxy.

              Example:

               curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" http://example.com/

              <B>WARNING</B>: headers set  with  this  option  will  be  set  in  all
              requests  -  even  after  redirects are followed, like when told
              with <I>-L,</I> <I>--location</I>. This can lead to the header being  sent  to
              other  hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers should
              be used with caution combined with following redirects.

              This option can be used  multiple  times  to  add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

       -h, --help
              Usage  help.  This lists all current command line options with a
              short description.

       --hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt;
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal  digits.  The
              string  should  be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's
              public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
              the md5sums match.

              Added in 7.17.1.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its
              internally preferred HTTP version.

              This option overrides <I>--http1.1</I> and <I>--http2</I>.

       --http1.1
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

              This option  overrides  <I>-0,</I>  <I>--http1.0</I>  and  <I>--http2</I>.  Added  in
              7.33.0.

       --http2-prior-knowledge
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to  issue  its  non-TLS HTTP requests using
              <I>-0,</I> <I>--http1.0</I> and <I>--http2-prior-knowledge</I>. Added in 7.33.0.

       --ignore-content-length
              (FTP  HTTP)  For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header. This is
              particularly useful for servers running Apache 1.x,  which  will
              report  incorrect  Content-Length  for files larger than 2 giga-
              bytes.

              For FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out  the
              size before downloading a file.

       -i, --include
              Include  the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes
              things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version  and
              more...

              See also <I>-v,</I> <I>--verbose</I>.

       -k, --insecure
              (TLS) By default, every SSL connection curl makes is verified to
              be secure. This option allows curl to proceed and  operate  even
              for server connections otherwise considered insecure.

              The  server  connection  is verified by making sure the server's
              certificate contains the right name  and  verifies  successfully
              using the cert store.

              See this online resource for further details:
               https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

              See also <I>--proxy-insecure</I> and <I>--cacert</I>.

       --interface &lt;name&gt;

              Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter
              interface name, IP address or host name. An example  could  look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>--dns-interface</I>.

       -4, --ipv4
              This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses  only,
              and not for example try IPv6.

              See  also  <I>--http1.1</I>  and  <I>--http2</I>.  This  option  overrides <I>-6,</I>
              <I>--ipv6</I>.

       -6, --ipv6

       --keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              This option sets the time a  connection  needs  to  remain  idle
              before  sending keepalive probes and the time between individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has  no
              effect if <I>--no-keepalive</I> is used.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

              Added in 7.18.0.

       --key-type &lt;type&gt;
              (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your <I>--key</I>  pro-
              vided  private  key  is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not
              specified, PEM is assumed.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --key &lt;key&gt;
              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
              vate key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,  curl
              tries the following candidates in order:

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --krb &lt;level&gt;
              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must  be
              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
              'private'. Should you use a level that  is  not  one  of  these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              <I>--krb</I> requires that the underlying libcurl was built to  support
              Kerberos.

       --libcurl &lt;file&gt;
              Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
              will get a libcurl-using C source code written to the file  that
              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

              If  this  option is used several times, the last given file name
              will be used.

              Added in 7.16.1.

       --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl  to  use  -  for
              both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a

       -l, --list-only
              (FTP  POP3)  (FTP)  When  listing  an FTP directory, this switch
              forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if  the  user
              wants  to  machine-parse  the contents of an FTP directory since
              the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format.
              When used like this, the option causes a NLST command to be sent
              to the server instead of LIST.

              Note: Some FTP servers list only  files  in  their  response  to
              NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

              (POP3)  When  retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch
              forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR.  This  is
              particularly  useful if the user wants to see if a specific mes-
              sage id exists on the server and what size it is.

              Note: When combined with <I>-X,</I> <I>--request</I>, this option can be  used
              to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's
              unique identifier rather  than  it's  message  id  to  make  the
              request.

              Added in 7.21.5.

       --local-port &lt;num/range&gt;
              Set  a  preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local port
              numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
              nature  are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so set-
              ting this range to something too narrow might cause  unnecessary
              connection setup failures.

              Added in 7.15.2.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP)  Like  <I>-L,</I>  <I>--location</I>, but will allow sending the name +
              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
              may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
              a site to which you'll send your authentication info  (which  is
              plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

              See also <I>-u,</I> <I>--user</I>.

       -L, --location
              (HTTP)  If  the server reports that the requested page has moved
              to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
              3XX  response code), this option will make curl redo the request
              on the new place. If used together with  <I>-i,</I>  <I>--include</I>  or  <I>-I,</I>
              <I>--head</I>,  headers  from  all  requested pages will be shown. When
              authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials  to  the
              initial  host.  If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it
              won't be able to intercept the user+password. See  also  <I>--loca-</I>
              <I>tion-trusted</I>  on how to change this. You can limit the amount of
              redirects to follow by using the <I>--max-redirs</I> option.

              You  can  use  the  login  options  to specify protocol specific
              options that may be used during authentication. At present  only
              IMAP,  POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information
              about the login options please see RFC 2384, RFC 5092  and  IETF
              draft draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.34.0.

       --mail-auth &lt;address&gt;
              (SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be  used  to  specify
              the  authentication  address  (identity)  of a submitted message
              that is being relayed to another server.

              See also <I>--mail-rcpt</I> and <I>--mail-from</I>. Added in 7.25.0.

       --mail-from &lt;address&gt;
              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail  should  get
              sent from.

              See also <I>--mail-rcpt</I> and <I>--mail-auth</I>. Added in 7.20.0.

       --mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt;
              (SMTP) Specify a single address, user name or mailing list name.
              Repeat this option several times to send to multiple recipients.

              When  performing a mail transfer, the recipient should specify a
              valid email address to send the mail to.

              When performing an  address  verification  (VRFY  command),  the
              recipient  should be specified as the user name or user name and
              domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
              ient  should  be  specified using the mailing list name, such as
              "Friends" or "London-Office".  (Added in 7.34.0)

              Added in 7.20.0.

       -M, --manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

       --max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
              Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file  to  download.  If
              the  file requested is larger than this value, the transfer will
              not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              <B>NOTE:</B> The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and
              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
              fer ends up being larger than this given  limit.  This  concerns
              take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
              ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down.   Since
              7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual time-
              out will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases
              in decimal precision.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>--connect-timeout</I>.

       --metalink
              This option can tell curl to parse and process a  given  URI  as
              Metalink  file  (both  version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are supported)
              and make use of the mirrors listed within for failover if  there
              are  errors (such as the file or server not being available). It
              will also verify the hash of the file after  the  download  com-
              pletes.  The Metalink file itself is downloaded and processed in
              memory and not stored in the local file system.

              Example to use a remote Metalink file:

               curl --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink

              To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE proto-
              col (file://):

               curl --metalink file://example.metalink

              Please  note  that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is no way
              to use a local Metalink file at the time of this  writing.  Also
              note  that  if  <I>--metalink</I>  and <I>-i,</I> <I>--include</I> are used together,
              --include will be ignored. This is because including headers  in
              the  response  will break Metalink parser and if the headers are
              included in the file described in Metalink file, hash check will
              fail.


              <I>--metalink</I>  requires  that  the  underlying libcurl was built to
              support metalink. Added in 7.27.0.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

              This option requires a library built with GSS-API or  SSPI  sup-
              port.  Use  <I>-V,</I>  <I>--version</I>  to  see  if  your curl supports GSS-
              API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

              When using this option, you must also provide a fake <I>-u,</I>  <I>--user</I>
              option  to  activate the authentication code properly. Sending a
              '-u :' is enough as the user name  and  password  from  the  <I>-u,</I>
              <I>--user</I> option aren't actually used.

              This option overrides <I>-n,</I> <I>--netrc</I>. Added in 7.21.5.

       --netrc-optional
              Very  similar  to  <I>-n,</I> <I>--netrc</I>, but this option makes the .netrc
              usage <B>optional</B> and not mandatory as the <I>-n,</I> <I>--netrc</I> option does.

              See also <I>--netrc-file</I>. This option overrides <I>-n,</I> <I>--netrc</I>.

       -n, --netrc
              Makes  curl  scan  the  <I>.netrc</I>  (<B>_</B><I>netrc</I>  on Windows) file in the
              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
              cally  used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable
              user authentication. See <I>ftp(1)</I> for details on the file  format.
              Curl  will not complain if that file doesn't have the right per-
              missions (it should not be either world- or group-readable). The
              environment  variable "HOME" is used to find the home directory.

              A quick and very simple example of how  to  setup  a  <I>.netrc</I>  to
              allow  curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name
              'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:

              <B>machine</B> <B>host.domain.com</B> <B>login</B> <B>myself</B> <B>password</B> <B>secret</B>

       -:, --next
              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
              associated   options.  This  allows  you  to  send  several  URL
              requests, each with their own  specific  options,  for  example,
              such as different user names or custom requests for each.

              <I>-:,</I>  <I>--next</I>  will  reset  all local options and only global ones
              will have their values survive over to the  operation  following
              the  <I>-:,</I>  <I>--next</I>  instruction. Global options include <I>-v,</I> <I>--ver-</I>
              <I>bose</I>, <I>--trace</I>, <I>--trace-ascii</I> and <I>--fail-early</I>.

              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a  single  com-
              mand line:

               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

              Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-alpn
              (HTTPS)  Disable  the  ALPN  TLS  extension.  ALPN is enabled by
              default if libcurl was built with an SSL library  that  supports
              ALPN.  ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negoti-
              ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

              See also <I>--no-npn</I>  and  <I>--http2</I>.  <I>--no-alpn</I>  requires  that  the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       -N, --no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-

       --no-npn
              (HTTPS) Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default
              if  libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN
              is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2  to  negotiate  HTTP/2
              support with the server during https sessions.

              See  also  <I>--no-alpn</I>  and  <I>--http2</I>.  <I>--no-npn</I>  requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-sessionid
              (TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By  default
              all  transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing
              should ever get hurt by attempting  to  reuse  SSL  session-IDs,
              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
              require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

              Added in 7.16.0.

       --noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
              Comma-separated  list  of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one
              is specified.  The only wildcard is a single * character,  which
              matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name
              in this list is matched as either a domain  which  contains  the
              hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, local.com would
              match  local.com,  local.com:80,  and  www.local.com,  but   not
              www.notlocal.com.

              Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
              that disable the proxy. If there's an environment variable  dis-
              abling a proxy, you can set noproxy list to "" to override it.

              Added in 7.19.4.

       --ntlm-wb
              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style <I>--ntlm</I> does, but hand over
              the authentication to the separate binary  ntlmauth  application
              that is executed when needed.

              See also <I>--ntlm</I> and <I>--proxy-ntlm</I>.

       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-
              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone
              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-
              tion method instead, such as Digest.

              <I>--user</I> options.

              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted  according  to  RFC
              6750.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -o, --output &lt;file&gt;
              Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              []  to  fetch  multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a
              number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That variable will  be  replaced
              with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

               curl http://{one,two}.example.com -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

               curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
              line, you can use it like this:

                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

              and  the  order  of  the -o options and the URLs doesn't matter,
              just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
              above command line can also be written as

                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

              See  also  the <I>--create-dirs</I> option to create the local directo-
              ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

              See   also  <I>-O,</I>  <I>--remote-name</I>  and  <I>--remote-name-all</I>  and  <I>-J,</I>
              <I>--remote-header-name</I>.

       --pass &lt;phrase&gt;
              (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --path-as-is
              Tell  curl  to  not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the given
              URL path. Normally curl will squash or merge them  according  to
              standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

              Added in 7.42.0.

       --pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
                7.47.0: mbedtls
                7.49.0: PolarSSL sha256 support:
                7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL/CyaSSL.
                7.47.0: mbedtls
                7.49.0: PolarSSL Other SSL backends not supported.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --post301
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
              non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers,  so  curl  does
              the  conversion  by  default to maintain consistency. However, a
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redi-
              rection.  This  option is meaningful only when using <I>-L,</I> <I>--loca-</I>
              <I>tion</I>.

              See also <I>--post302</I> and <I>--post303</I> and <I>-L,</I>  <I>--location</I>.  Added  in
              7.17.1.

       --post302
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
              non-RFC  behaviour  is  ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does
              the conversion by default to maintain  consistency.  However,  a
              server  may  require  a POST to remain a POST after such a redi-
              rection. This option is meaningful only when using  <I>-L,</I>  <I>--loca-</I>
              <I>tion</I>.

              See  also  <I>--post301</I>  and <I>--post303</I> and <I>-L,</I> <I>--location</I>. Added in
              7.19.1.

       --post303
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 303 redirection. The
              non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers,  so  curl  does
              the  conversion  by  default to maintain consistency. However, a
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redi-

              7.26.0.

       --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use  the  specified  SOCKS proxy before connecting to an HTTP or
              HTTPS <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>. In such a case curl  first  connects  to  the
              SOCKS  proxy  and  then  connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or
              HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
              fix  to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use socks4://,

       -#, --progress-bar
              Make curl display transfer progress as  a  simple  progress  bar
              instead of the standard, more informational, meter.

              This  progress  bar draws a single line of '#' characters across
              the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
              For  transfers  without a known size, it will instead output one
              '#' character for every 1024 bytes transferred.

       --proto-default &lt;protocol&gt;
              Tells curl to use <I>protocol</I> for any URL missing a scheme name.

              Example:

               curl --proto-default https ftp.mozilla.org

              An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>UNSUP-</I>
              <I>PORTED</I><B>_</B><I>PROTOCOL</I> (1).

              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

              Without  this  option curl would make a guess based on the host,
              see <I>--url</I> for details.

              Added in 7.45.0.

       --proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect.  Pro-
              tocols  denied by <I>--proto</I> are not overridden by this option. See
              --proto for how protocols are represented.

              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

               curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

              By default curl will allow all protocols on redirect except sev-
              eral  disabled  for  security reasons: Since 7.19.4 FILE and SCP
              are disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS are  also  disabled.
              Specifying  <I>all</I>  or  <I>+all</I>  enables  all  protocols  on redirect,
              including those disabled for security.

              Added in 7.20.2.

       --proto &lt;protocols&gt;
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use in  the  transfer.
              Protocols  are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and
              are each a protocol name or

              <B>+</B>  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
                 ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

              <I>--proto</I> <B>=http,https</B>
                             also only enables http and https

       Unknown protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to safely rely
       on being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without rely-
       ing upon support for that protocol being built into curl  to  avoid  an
       error.

       This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the
       same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the option.

       See also <I>--proto-redir</I> and <I>--proto-default</I>. Added in 7.20.2.

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when  commu-
              nicating  with  the  given HTTP proxy. This might cause an extra
              request/response round-trip.

              See also <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> and <I>--proxy-basic</I> and <I>--proxy-digest</I>. Added
              in 7.13.2.

       --proxy-basic
              Tells  curl  to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use <I>--basic</I> for enabling HTTP Basic with a
              remote  host.  Basic  is  the default authentication method curl
              uses with proxies.

              See also <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> and <I>--proxy-anyauth</I> and <I>--proxy-digest</I>.

       --proxy-cacert &lt;file&gt;
              Same as <I>--cacert</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              See also  <I>--proxy-capath</I>  and  <I>--cacert</I>  and  <I>--capath</I>  and  <I>-x,</I>

       --proxy-capath &lt;dir&gt;
              Same as <I>--capath</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              See  also  <I>--proxy-cacert</I> and <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> and <I>--capath</I>. Added in

       --proxy-cert-type &lt;type&gt;
              Same as <I>--cert-type</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert &lt;cert[:passwd]&gt;
              Same as <I>-E,</I> <I>--cert</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              See also <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> and <I>--proxy-anyauth</I> and <I>--proxy-basic</I>.

       --proxy-header &lt;header&gt;
              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
              to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
              the equivalent option to <I>-H,</I> <I>--header</I> but is for proxy  communi-
              cation  only  like  in CONNECT requests when you want a separate
              header sent to the proxy to what is sent to  the  actual  remote
              host.

              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <B>not</B> add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              Headers specified with this  option  will  not  be  included  in
              requests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

              Added in 7.37.0.

       --proxy-insecure
              Same as <I>-k,</I> <I>--insecure</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key-type &lt;type&gt;
              Same as <I>--key-type</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key &lt;key&gt;
              Same as <I>--key</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

       --proxy-negotiate
              Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate  (SPNEGO)  authentication  when
              communicating with the given proxy. Use <I>--negotiate</I> for enabling
              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

              See also <I>--proxy-anyauth</I> and <I>--proxy-basic</I>. Added in 7.17.1.

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM  authentication  when  communicating
              with the given proxy. Use <I>--ntlm</I> for enabling NTLM with a remote
              host.

              See also <I>--proxy-negotiate</I> and <I>--proxy-anyauth</I>.

       --proxy-pass &lt;phrase&gt;
              Same as <I>--pass</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

       --proxy-tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
              Same as <I>--tlsauthtype</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlspassword &lt;string&gt;
              Same as <I>--tlspassword</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
              Same as <I>--tlsuser</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsv1
              Same as <I>-1,</I> <I>--tlsv1</I> but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       -U, --proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
              Specify  the user name and password to use for proxy authentica-
              tion.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled  curl  binary  and  do  either
              Negotiate  or  NTLM  authentication  then  you  can tell curl to
              select the user name and password from your environment by spec-
              ifying a single colon with this option: "-U :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified proxy.

              The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix.  No
              protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
              socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
              cific SOCKS version to be used.  (The protocol support was added
              in curl 7.21.7)

              HTTPS proxy support via https:// protocol prefix  was  added  in
              7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

              Unrecognized  and  unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause an error
              since 7.52.0.  Prior versions may ignore the  protocol  and  use
              http:// instead.

              If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
              assumed to be 1080.

              This option overrides existing environment  variables  that  set
              the  proxy  to use. If there's an environment variable setting a
              and the embedded user + password.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --proxy1.0 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  <I>-x,</I>
              <I>--proxy</I>,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
              specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

       -p, --proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>, this option  will  cause
              non-HTTP  protocols  to  attempt  to  tunnel  through  the proxy
              instead of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations. The  tun-
              nel  approach  is  made  with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and
              requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the remote port
              number curl wants to tunnel through to.

              To  suppress  proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to
              output headers use <I>--suppress-connect-headers</I>.

              See also <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>.

       --pubkey &lt;key&gt;
              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
              lic key in this separate file.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
              key  from the private key file, so passing this option is gener-
              ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
              libcurl  to  be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher
              that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

       -Q, --quote
              (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
              server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
              (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
              prefix them with a dash '-'.  To make  commands  be  sent  after
              curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer
              command(s), prefix the command with a '+'  (this  is  only  sup-
              ported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.

              If  the  server  returns  failure  for  one of the commands, the
              entire operation will be aborted. You  must  send  syntactically
              correct  FTP  commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one
              of the commands listed below to SFTP servers.

                     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              chmod mode file
                     The chmod command modifies the  file  mode  bits  of  the
                     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                     number.

              chown user file
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                     file  operand  to the user ID specified by the user oper-
                     and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              ln source_file target_file
                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                     target_file  location  pointing  to the source_file loca-
                     tion.

              mkdir directory_name
                     The mkdir command creates  the  directory  named  by  the
                     directory_name operand.

              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                     rent working directory.

              rename source target
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                     the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                     target operand.

              rm file
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                     erand.

              rmdir directory
                     The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

              symlink source_file target_file
                     See ln.

       --random-file &lt;file&gt;
              Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
              as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
              for SSL connections.  See also the <I>--egd-file</I> option.

       -r, --range &lt;range&gt;
              (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial  docu-
              ment)  from  a  HTTP/1.1,  FTP  or  SFTP server or a local FILE.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              <B>0-499</B>     specifies the first 500 bytes

              Only  digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and 'stop'
              fields of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit  charac-
              ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
              ified, depending on the server's configuration.

              You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not  have
              this  feature  enabled, so that when you attempt to get a range,
              you'll instead get the whole document.

              FTP and SFTP range downloads only  support  the  simple  'start-
              stop'  syntax  (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP
              use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
              tent or transfer encodings and  instead  makes  them  passed  on
              unaltered, raw.

              Added in 7.16.2.

       -e, --referer &lt;URL&gt;
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server.
              This can also be set with the <I>-H,</I> <I>--header</I> flag of course.  When
              used  with  <I>-L,</I>  <I>--location</I>  you  can  append ";auto" to the <I>-e,</I>
              <I>--referer</I> URL to make curl automatically set  the  previous  URL
              when  it  follows  a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be
              used alone, even if you don't set an initial <I>-e,</I> <I>--referer</I>.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-A,</I> <I>--user-agent</I> and <I>-H,</I> <I>--header</I>.

       -J, --remote-header-name
              (HTTP) This option tells the <I>-O,</I> <I>--remote-name</I> option to use the
              server-specified   Content-Disposition   filename   instead   of
              extracting a filename from the URL.

              If  the  server  specifies a file name and a file with that name
              already exists in the current working directory it will  not  be
              overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't spec-
              ify a file name then this option has no effect.

              There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in  the  provided
              file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
              file names.

              <B>WARNING</B>: Exercise judicious use of this  option,  especially  on
              Windows.  A  rogue  server  could  send you the name of a DLL or
              other file that could possibly be loaded automatically  by  Win-
              dows or some third party software.

              want  the  file  saved  in  a different directory, make sure you
              change the current working directory before invoking  curl  with
              this option.

              The  remote  file  name  to use for saving is extracted from the
              given URL, nothing else, and if it already  exists  it  will  be
              overwritten.  If  you  want  the server to be able to choose the
              file name refer to <I>-J,</I> <I>--remote-header-name</I> which can be used in
              addition  to  this option. If the server chooses a file name and
              that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
              other  URL  encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as
              file name.

              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you
              have.

       -R, --remote-time
              When  used,  this will make curl attempt to figure out the time-
              stamp of the remote file, and if  that  is  available  make  the
              local file get that same timestamp.

       -X, --request &lt;command&gt;
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
              ing with the HTTP server.  The specified request method will  be
              used  instead  of  the  method otherwise used (which defaults to
              GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details  and  explana-
              tions.  Common  additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE,
              but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
              and more.

              Normally  you  don't  need  this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD,
              POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
              mand line options.

              This  option  only  changes  the  actual  word  used in the HTTP
              request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for  example
              if  you  want  to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will
              not suffice. You need to use the <I>-I,</I> <I>--head</I> option.

              The method string you set with <I>-X,</I> <I>--request</I> will  be  used  for
              all  requests,  which  if you for example use <I>-L,</I> <I>--location</I> may
              cause unintended side-effects when curl doesn't  change  request
              method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
              doing file lists with FTP.

              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
              RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)

              for  the  specific  protocol the host will be used for. It means
              you need several entries if you want to provide address for  the
              same host but different ports.

              The provided address set by this option will be used even if <I>-4,</I>
              <I>--ipv4</I> or <I>-6,</I> <I>--ipv6</I> is set to make curl use another IP version.

              This  option  can  be  used many times to add many host names to
              resolve.

              Added in 7.21.3.

       --retry-connrefused
              In addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as  a
              transient  error  too  for <I>--retry</I>. This option is used together
              with --retry.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       --retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;
              Make curl sleep this amount of time before  each  retry  when  a
              transfer  has  failed  with  a  transient  error (it changes the
              default backoff time algorithm between retries). This option  is
              only  interesting if <I>--retry</I> is also used. Setting this delay to
              zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.12.3.

       --retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              The  retry  timer  is  reset  before the first transfer attempt.
              Retries will be done as usual (see <I>--retry</I>) as long as the timer
              hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't
              reached the limit, the request will be made and  while  perform-
              ing,  it may take longer than this given time period. To limit a
              single request's maximum time, use  <I>-m,</I>  <I>--max-time</I>.   Set  this
              option to zero to not timeout retries.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.12.3.

       --retry &lt;num&gt;
              If a transient error is returned when curl tries  to  perform  a
              transfer,  it  will retry this number of times before giving up.
              Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which  is  the
              default).  Transient  error  means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx
              response code or an HTTP 5xx response code.

              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one
              second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the

       --service-name &lt;name&gt;
              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

              Examples:   <I>--negotiate</I>   <I>--service-name</I>   sockd    would    use
              sockd/server-name.

              Added in 7.43.0.

       -S, --show-error
              When used with <I>-s,</I> <I>--silent</I>, it makes curl show an error message
              if it fails.

       -s, --silent
              Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  mes-
              sages.   Makes  Curl mute. It will still output the data you ask
              for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
              it.

              Use  <I>-S,</I>  <I>--show-error</I>  in  addition  to  this option to disable
              progress meter but still show error messages.

              See also <I>-v,</I> <I>--verbose</I> and <I>--stderr</I>.

       --socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
              fied, it is assumed at port 1080.

              This  option  overrides any previous use of <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
              socks4 proxy with <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> using a socks4:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, <I>--preproxy</I> can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.15.2.

       --socks4a &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
              ified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              This  option  overrides any previous use of <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
              socks4a  proxy with <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> using a socks4a:// protocol pre-
              fix.
              <I>--socks5-gssapi-nec</I>  allows the unprotected exchange of the pro-
              tection mode negotiation.

              Added in 7.19.4.

       --socks5-gssapi-service &lt;name&gt;
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
              This option allows you to change it.

              Examples:   <I>--socks5</I>  proxy-name  <I>--socks5-gssapi-service</I>  sockd
              would use sockd/proxy-name <I>--socks5</I> proxy-name  <I>--socks5-gssapi-</I>
              <I>service</I>  sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for cases
              where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

              Added in 7.19.4.

       --socks5-hostname &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the  proxy  resolve  the
              host  name).  If the port number is not specified, it is assumed
              at port 1080.

              This option overrides any previous use of <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
              socks5 hostname proxy with <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> using a socks5h:// proto-
              col prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, <I>--preproxy</I> can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.18.0.

       --socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
              Use  the  specified  SOCKS5  proxy  -  but resolve the host name
              locally. If the port number is not specified, it is  assumed  at
              port 1080.

              This  option  overrides any previous use of <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
              socks5 proxy with <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> using a socks5:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, <I>--preproxy</I> can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

       -y, --speed-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second during
              a speed-time period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is
              used, the default speed-limit will be  1  unless  set  with  <I>-Y,</I>
              <I>--speed-limit</I>.

              This  option  controls  transfers  and thus will not affect slow
              connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try  the  <I>--connect-</I>
              <I>timeout</I> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --ssl-allow-beast
              This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
              SSL3  and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option isn't
              used, the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause  interop-
              erability problems with some older SSL implementations. WARNING:
              this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this flag you
              ask for exactly that.

              Added in 7.25.0.

       --ssl-no-revoke
              (WinSSL)  This  option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
              tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
              by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Added in 7.44.0.

       --ssl-reqd
              (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.  Termi-
              nates the connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

              Added in 7.20.0.

       --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Try to  use  SSL/TLS  for  the  connection.
              Reverts to a non-secure connection if the server doesn't support
              SSL/TLS.  See also <I>--ftp-ssl-control</I> and <I>--ssl-reqd</I> for  differ-
              ent levels of encryption required.

              This  option  was formerly known as --ftp-ssl (Added in 7.11.0).
              That option name can still be used but  will  be  removed  in  a
              future version.

              Added in 7.20.0.

       -2, --sslv2
              (SSL)  Forces  curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a
              remote SSL server. Sometimes curl is built  without  SSLv2  sup-

       --stderr
              Redirect  all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If
              the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              See also <I>-v,</I> <I>--verbose</I> and <I>-s,</I> <I>--silent</I>.

       --suppress-connect-headers
              When  <I>-p,</I>  <I>--proxytunnel</I>  is  used and a CONNECT request is made
              don't output proxy CONNECT  response  headers.  This  option  is
              meant  to  be used with <I>-D,</I> <I>--dump-header</I> or <I>-i,</I> <I>--include</I> which
              are used to show protocol headers  in  the  output.  It  has  no
              effect on debug options such as <I>-v,</I> <I>--verbose</I> or <I>--trace</I>, or any
              statistics.

              See also <I>-D,</I> <I>--dump-header</I> and <I>-i,</I> <I>--include</I> and <I>-p,</I> <I>--proxytun-</I>
              <I>nel</I>.

       --tcp-fastopen
              Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

              Added in 7.49.0.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt(3)</I> man
              page for details about this option.

              Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you  need  to
              explicitly switch it off if you don't want it on.

              Added in 7.11.2.

       -t, --telnet-option &lt;opt=val&gt;
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

       --tftp-blksize &lt;value&gt;
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be &gt;512). This is the block
              size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
              a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Added in 7.20.0.

              and tries to get  the  modification  date  (mtime)  from  &lt;file&gt;
              instead.  See  the <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>getdate(3)</I> man pages for date expression
              details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
              a  document that is older than the given date/time, default is a
              document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       --tls-max &lt;VERSION&gt;
              (SSL)  VERSION  defines maximum supported TLS version. A minimum
              is defined by arguments tlsv1.0 or tlsv1.1 or tlsv1.2.


              default
                     Use up to recommended TLS version.

              1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.

              1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.

              1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.

              1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

       See also <I>--tlsv1.0</I> and <I>--tlsv1.1</I> and <I>--tlsv1.2</I>. <I>--tls-max</I> requires that
       the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.54.0.

       --tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
              Set  TLS  authentication  type.  Currently,  the  only supported
              option is "SRP",  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  <I>--tlsuser</I>  and
              <I>--tlspassword</I>  are specified but <I>--tlsauthtype</I> is not, then this
              option defaults to "SRP".

              Added in 7.21.4.

       --tlspassword
              Set password for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
              fied with <I>--tlsauthtype</I>. Requires that <I>--tlsuser</I> also be set.

              Added in 7.21.4.

       --tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
              Set  username  for use with the TLS authentication method speci-
              fied with <I>--tlsauthtype</I>. Requires  that  <I>--tlspassword</I>  also  is
              set.

              Added in 7.21.4.

       --tlsv1.0
              (TLS)  Forces  curl  to use TLS version 1.0 when connecting to a
              Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.3
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 when  connecting  to  a
              remote TLS server.

              Note that TLS 1.3 is only supported by a subset of TLS backends.
              At the time of writing this, those are BoringSSL and NSS only.

              Added in 7.52.0.

       -1, --tlsv1
              (SSL) Tells curl to use TLS version 1.x when negotiating with  a
              remote TLS server. That means TLS version 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2.

              See  also  <I>--http1.1</I>  and <I>--http2</I>. <I>-1,</I> <I>--tlsv1</I> requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This  option  over-
              rides <I>--tlsv1.1</I> and <I>--tlsv1.2</I> and <I>--tlsv1.3</I>.

       --tr-encoding
              (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
              of the algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the  data  while
              receiving it.

              Added in 7.21.6.

       --trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;
              Enables  a  full  trace  dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
              including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is very similar to <I>--trace</I>, but leaves out the hex part and
              only shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes  smaller  output
              that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              This option overrides <I>--trace</I> and <I>-v,</I> <I>--verbose</I>.

       --trace-time
              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose  line  that  curl
              displays.

              Added in 7.14.0.

       --trace &lt;file&gt;
              Enables  a  full  trace  dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
              including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use
              "-"  as  filename  to have the output sent to stdout. Use "%" as
              filename to have the output sent to stderr.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
              fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
              be used.

              Use  the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
              given file.  Alternately, the file name "."  (a  single  period)
              may  be  specified  instead  of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking
              mode to  allow  reading  server  output  while  stdin  is  being
              uploaded.

              You  can  specify one <I>-T,</I> <I>--upload-file</I> for each URL on the com-
              mand line. Each <I>-T,</I> <I>--upload-file</I> + URL pair specifies  what  to
              upload  and  to  where. curl also supports "globbing" of the <I>-T,</I>
              <I>--upload-file</I> argument, meaning that  you  can  upload  multiple
              files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style sup-
              ported in the URL, like this:

               curl --upload-file "{file1,file2}" http://www.example.com

              or even

               curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.example.com/upload/

              When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data  is  assumed
              to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
              headers and mail body formatted correctly by the  user  as  curl
              will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

       --url &lt;url&gt;
              Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://"  or
              "ftp://"  etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host. If
              the outermost sub-domain name matches  DICT,  FTP,  IMAP,  LDAP,
              POP3  or  SMTP  then  that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
              will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
              default protocol, see <I>--proto-default</I> for details.

              This  option  may  be used any number of times. To control where
              this URL is written, use the <I>-o,</I> <I>--output</I> or the  <I>-O,</I>  <I>--remote-</I>
              <I>name</I> options.

       -B, --use-ascii
              (FTP  LDAP)  Enable  ASCII  transfer.  For FTP, this can also be
              enforced by using a URL that ends with  ";type=A".  This  option
              causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

       -A, --user-agent &lt;name&gt;
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
              this option. The password can, still.

              When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based  server  you  should
              include  the  Windows domain name in the user name, in order for
              the server to successfully obtain  a  Kerberos  Ticket.  If  you
              don't then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

              When  using  NTLM,  the user name can be specified simply as the
              user name, without the domain, if there is a single  domain  and
              forest in your setup for example.

              To  specify  the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
              user@example.com respectively.

              If  you  use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Ker-
              beros V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you  can
              tell  curl  to select the user name and password from your envi-
              ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: "-u :".

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation. Useful for debugging
              and seeing what's going on "under the  hood".  A  line  starting
              with  '&gt;'  means  "header  data" sent by curl, '&lt;' means "header
              data" received by curl that is hidden in  normal  cases,  and  a
              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, <I>-i,</I> <I>--include</I> might
              be the option you're looking for.

              If you think this option still doesn't give you enough  details,
              consider using <I>--trace</I> or <I>--trace-ascii</I> instead.

              Use <I>-s,</I> <I>--silent</I> to make curl really quiet.

              See  also  <I>-i,</I>  <I>--include</I>.  This  option  overrides  <I>--trace</I> and
              <I>--trace-ascii</I>.

       -V, --version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

              The  first  line  includes the full version of curl, libcurl and
              other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

              The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows  all  protocols
              that libcurl reports to support.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features
              libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

                     developers only!

              AsynchDNS
                     This curl uses asynchronous name  resolves.  Asynchronous
                     name  resolves can be done using either the c-ares or the
                     threaded resolver backends.

              SPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.

              Largefile
                     This curl supports transfers of large files, files larger
                     than 2GB.

              IDN    This curl supports IDN - international domain names.

              GSS-API
                     GSS-API is supported.

              SSPI   SSPI is supported.

              TLS-SRP
                     SRP  (Secure Remote Password) authentication is supported
                     for TLS.

              HTTP2  HTTP/2 support has been built-in.

              UnixSockets
                     Unix sockets support is provided.

              HTTPS-proxy
                     This curl is built to support HTTPS proxy.

              Metalink
                     This curl supports Metalink (both version 3  and  4  (RFC
                     5854)),  which  describes  mirrors and hashes.  curl will
                     use mirrors for failover if there are errors (such as the
                     file or server not being available).

              PSL    PSL  is  short for Public Suffix List and means that this
                     curl has been built with  knowledge  about  "public  suf-
                     fixes".

       -w, --write-out &lt;format&gt;
              Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
              fer. The format is a string that may contain  plain  text  mixed
              with  any  number of variables. The format can be specified as a
              literal "string", or you can have curl read the  format  from  a
              file  with  "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from
              stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will  be  substituted
              by  the  value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below.
                             The  ultimate  filename  that curl writes out to.
                             This is only meaningful if curl is told to  write
                             to  a  file  with  the  <I>-O,</I>  <I>--remote-name</I> or <I>-o,</I>
                             <I>--output</I> option. It's most useful in  combination
                             with  the <I>-J,</I> <I>--remote-header-name</I> option. (Added
                             in 7.26.0)

              <B>ftp_entry_path</B> The initial path curl ended up in when logging on
                             to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)

                             The  time,  in  seconds,  it  took from the start
                             until the name resolving was completed.

              <B>time_pretransfer</B>
                             The time, in seconds,  it  took  from  the  start
                             until  the file transfer was just about to begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-

                             tion time for multiple  redirections.  (Added  in
                             7.12.3)

              <B>time_starttransfer</B>
                             The  time,  in  seconds,  it  took from the start
                             until the first byte was just about to be  trans-

                             ingful  if  you've  told curl to follow location:
                             headers.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

       The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case.
       The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it
       is only available in lower case.

       Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same  effect  as
       using the <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I> option.


       http_proxy [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.

       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       [url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets  the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the pro-
              tocol is a protocol that curl supports and  as  specified  in  a
              URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP etc.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]
              Sets  the  proxy  server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is
              set.

       NO_PROXY &lt;comma-separated list of hosts&gt;
              list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy.  If  set
              to a asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts.

              Since  7.53.0,  this environment variable disable the proxy even
              if specify <I>-x,</I> <I>--proxy</I>  option.  That  is  <B>NO_PROXY=direct.exam-</B>
              <B>ple.com</B>  <B>curl</B>  <B>-x</B>  <B>http://proxy.example.com</B>  <B>http://direct.exam-</B>
              <B>ple.com</B>    accesses    the    target    URL    directly,     and
              <B>NO_PROXY=direct.example.com</B>   <B>curl</B>  <B>-x</B>  <B>http://proxy.example.com</B>
              <B>http://somewhere.example.com</B> accesses  the  target  URL  through
              proxy.

<H2>PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES</H2><PRE>
       Since  curl  version  7.21.7,  the proxy string may be specified with a
       protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.

       If no protocol is specified in  the  proxy  string  or  if  the  string
       doesn't  match  a  supported  one, the proxy will be treated as an HTTP
       proxy.

       The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

       socks4://
              Makes it the equivalent of <I>--socks4</I>

       socks4a://
              Makes it the equivalent of <I>--socks4a</I>

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

       4      A  feature  or  option  that  was  needed to perform the desired
              request was not enabled or was  explicitly  disabled  at  build-
              time.  To  make  curl able to do this, you probably need another
              build of libcurl!

       5      Couldn't resolve proxy.  The  given  proxy  host  could  not  be
              resolved.

       6      Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.

       7      Failed to connect to host.

       8      Weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.

       9      FTP  access  denied. The server denied login or denied access to
              the particular resource or directory you wanted to  reach.  Most
              often  you  tried to change to a directory that doesn't exist on
              the server.

       10     FTP accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect  back
              when  an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent over
              the control connection or similar.

       11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to  the
              PASS request.

       12     During  an  active  FTP  session while waiting for the server to
              connect back to curl, the timeout expired.

       13     FTP weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to  the
              PASV request.

       14     FTP  weird  227  format.  Curl  couldn't  parse the 227-line the
              server sent.

       15     FTP can't get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got  in  the
              227-line.

       16     HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer.
              This is somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems,
              see the error message for details.

       17     FTP  couldn't  set  binary.  Couldn't  change transfer method to
              binary.

       18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

       19     FTP couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or  simi-
       26     Read error. Various reading problems.

       27     Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.

       28     Operation timeout. The specified  time-out  period  was  reached
              according to the conditions.

       30     FTP  PORT  failed.  The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers
              support the PORT  command,  try  doing  a  transfer  using  PASV
              instead!

       31     FTP  couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is
              used for resumed FTP transfers.

       33     HTTP range error. The range "command" didn't work.

       34     HTTP post error. Internal post-request generation error.

       35     SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.

       36     Bad download resume. Couldn't continue an earlier aborted  down-
              load.

       37     FILE couldn't read file. Failed to open the file. Permissions?

       38     LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.

       39     LDAP search failed.

       41     Function not found. A required LDAP function was not found.

       42     Aborted by callback. An application told curl to abort the oper-
              ation.

       43     Internal error. A function was called with a bad parameter.

       45     Interface error. A specified outgoing  interface  could  not  be
              used.

       47     Too many redirects. When following redirects, curl hit the maxi-
              mum amount.

       48     Unknown option specified to libcurl.  This  indicates  that  you
              passed  a weird option to curl that was passed on to libcurl and
              rejected. Read up in the manual!

       49     Malformed telnet option.

       51     The peer's SSL certificate or SSH MD5 fingerprint was not OK.

       52     The server didn't reply anything, which here  is  considered  an
              error.
              cates.

       61     Unrecognized transfer encoding.

       62     Invalid LDAP URL.

       63     Maximum file size exceeded.

       64     Requested FTP SSL level failed.

       65     Sending the data requires a rewind that failed.

       66     Failed to initialise SSL Engine.

       67     The user name, password, or similar was not  accepted  and  curl
              failed to log in.

       68     File not found on TFTP server.

       69     Permission problem on TFTP server.

       70     Out of disk space on TFTP server.

       71     Illegal TFTP operation.

       72     Unknown TFTP transfer ID.

       73     File already exists (TFTP).

       74     No such user (TFTP).

       75     Character conversion failed.

       76     Character conversion functions required.

       77     Problem with reading the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?).

       78     The resource referenced in the URL does not exist.

       79     An unspecified error occurred during the SSH session.

       80     Failed to shut down the SSL connection.

       82     Could  not  load  CRL  file,  missing  or wrong format (added in
              7.19.0).

       83     Issuer check failed (added in 7.19.0).

       84     The FTP PRET command failed
